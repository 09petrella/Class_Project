Machine Learning to analyze Hulu Data

Database: Data will be stored in AWS and we will create a database engine that will allow Pandas to communicate with PostgresSQL


Plan for the model - Put in name of actor and see what name would be… how much is this movie going to make based off of this actor… / director…
